The python scripts/functions/classes in this directory
will download (almost) all ERA-Interim variables at
the surface and on pressure levels for both forecasts
and analyses. 

The scripts check to see if data is already downloaded
so do not worry about having to wait for data to 
redownload.

To get the newest data, simply run the
erai_download_all.py
script.

Note that you need an ECMWF API key, which is easy
to get if you already have an account. Just go to
the following link:
